        <h3>Decorating with plants is simple</h3>
        <p>
          To create the most interesting display, use a mixture of plant sizes
          and leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa the peace lily, mixed with
          something sculptural like Susie the snake plant and a soft fern like
          Bertie gives an attractive range of textures. Hanging plants, like
          Rapunzel the golden pothos, add interest at different heights. Donâ€™t
          forget your pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while a
          mix of styles and patterns looks eclectic and fun.
